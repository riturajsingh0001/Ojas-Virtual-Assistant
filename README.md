# Ojas-Virtual-Assistant
OJAS – Vitural Assistant

Made in India • Made for India


---

Overview

OJAS is my four-year capstone journey to build a truly human-centric virtual assistant. Started in Year 1 (2025) and scheduled for completion by Year 4 (2028), OJAS blends cutting-edge language models, emotional intelligence, and hyper-local personalization—delivering capabilities that today’s mainstream assistants don’t offer.

Key Differentiators

Capability	Google Assistant / Alexa	 & OJAS

1. Contextual Long-Term Memory:	Limited (“short-lived” context)	Remembers user preferences, routines, relationships, mood history
2. Emotion-Aware Responses:	No native sentiment adaptation	Real-time tone detection → empathy-driven replies & mental-health check-ins
3. Life-Logging Journal:	Not supported	Daily voice/text reflections auto-summarized into a private diary
4. Geofenced Smart Reminders:	Basic location triggers	Multi-criteria (“Remind me to stretch when I reach library after 7 PM”)
5. Regional Language Fusion:	Single language per query	Seamless Hinglish + regional dialect code-switching
6. Vision-Assisted Insights:	Separate apps	Planned camera module: “What plant is this?” / “Is my posture correct?”
